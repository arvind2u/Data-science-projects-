Anomaly detection in network Logs 
We have network logs data cotaining different ports, latency and througputs 
Latency = Time required for packets to reach the destination 
thorughput = Number of packets sent in specific time 
with the help of this data we can detect the anomalies in network 
Model Implimentation and deploying id done by using Pytorch.
